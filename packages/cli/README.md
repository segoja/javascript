# Lemon Command Line Tool

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40stanlemon%2Fcli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40stanlemon%2Fcli)

Everyone needs their own command line tool!

There is currently one command, `create` which will create a copy of `@stanlemon/app-template` in the directory you specify.

You can use it like this:

```shell
npx @stanlemon/cli@latest create my-awesome-webapp
```

Some day there may be more, so stay tuned!
